# GitHub Actions CI/CD Setup Guide

## Overview

This project uses GitHub Actions for automated testing and code quality checks. Two main workflows have been configured:

1. **pytest-coverage.yml** - Test execution and coverage validation (80% minimum)
2. **code-quality.yml** - Linting and code formatting checks

## Quick Start

### For Developers

No setup required! Just push to a PR or push to `main`/`develop` branches with Python file changes.

**What happens automatically:**
1. Tests run on Python 3.9, 3.11, and 3.13
2. Coverage is calculated and checked against 80% threshold
3. Code is linted with Ruff
4. Formatting is validated
5. PR gets automatic comments with results

### For Project Maintainers

**CI Status:**
- Check PRs for automated test results
- Coverage reports available in Actions artifacts
- Merge only when all checks pass (branch protection recommended)

## Workflow Details

### 1. pytest-coverage.yml

**File:** `.github/workflows/pytest-coverage.yml`

**Triggers:**
- Pull requests with Python file changes
- Pushes to `main` or `develop` with Python file changes

**What it does:**

```
1. Checkout code
   â†“
2. Set up Python (3.9, 3.11, 3.13)
   â†“
3. Install dev dependencies
   â†“
4. Run pytest with coverage reporting
   â†“
5. Check coverage >= 80%
   â†“
6. Comment on PR with results
   â†“
7. Upload HTML coverage report
   â†“
8. Fail if below threshold
```

**Key Configuration:**
- **Coverage threshold:** 80% (enforced)
- **Tested Python versions:** 3.9, 3.11, 3.13
- **Test location:** `tests/` directory
- **Timeout:** 10 minutes

**Coverage Reports Generated:**
- Terminal summary (in logs)
- XML format (`coverage.xml` - machine readable)
- HTML format (`htmlcov/` - human readable)
- Artifact retention: 30 days

**Example PR Comment:**
```
## Test Results

- **Coverage:** 99%
- **Threshold:** 80%
- **Status:** âœ… All checks passed
```

### 2. code-quality.yml

**File:** `.github/workflows/code-quality.yml`

**Triggers:**
- Pull requests with Python file changes
- Pushes to `main` or `develop` with Python file changes

**What it does:**

```
1. Checkout code
   â†“
2. Set up Python 3.13
   â†“
3. Install linting tools (ruff, isort)
   â†“
4. Run Ruff linter
   â†“
5. Run Ruff formatter check
   â†“
6. Run isort import checker
   â†“
7. Comment on PR if issues found
```

**Linting Rules (from pyproject.toml):**
- Error codes: E4, E7, E9, F (Pyflakes and pycodestyle basics)
- Line length: 120 characters
- Quote style: Double quotes
- Indent: 4 spaces
- Python target: 3.13

**Continues on error:** Issues are reported but don't block merge

## Coverage Threshold: 80%

### Why 80%?

- **High enough** to catch untested code
- **Realistic** for production code
- **Achievable** without excessive test bloat
- **Your project** currently at 99% âœ¨

### Current Status

**sd_monitor.py:** 99% coverage
- 81 statements
- 1 missed line (if __name__ == "__main__")
- 82 passing tests

### Viewing Coverage Reports

**In GitHub:**
1. Go to completed workflow run
2. Click "Artifacts" section
3. Download `coverage-report-py3.13`
4. Extract and open `htmlcov/index.html`

**Locally:**
```bash
pytest tests/ --cov=. --cov-report=html
open htmlcov/index.html  # macOS
```

## Local Development Workflow

### Before committing:

```bash
# Install dev dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Run tests with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing

# Check coverage
python -m coverage report --fail-under=80
```

### If coverage is below 80%:

```bash
# Find uncovered lines
python -m coverage report --skip-covered
python -m coverage html  # Generate HTML report
open htmlcov/index.html  # View in browser

# Add tests for uncovered code
# Then re-run pytest
```

### Code quality checks:

```bash
# Run linting
ruff check .

# Check formatting
ruff format . --check

# Check imports
isort . --check-only

# Auto-fix everything
ruff check . --fix
ruff format .
isort .
```

## Branch Protection Rules (Recommended)

For maximum CI/CD benefit, configure GitHub branch protection:

**Settings â†’ Branches â†’ Branch protection rule â†’ main**

Enable:
- âœ… Require status checks to pass before merging
  - Select `test` from pytest-coverage workflow
  - Select `lint` from code-quality workflow
- âœ… Require branches to be up to date before merging
- âœ… Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed

This ensures:
- All tests pass before merge
- Coverage doesn't drop
- Code meets quality standards
- No outdated PRs merged

## Artifact Management

**Auto-cleanup:** 30 days retention

If you need longer retention:
1. Go to workflow file
2. Change `retention-days: 30` to desired value

**Storage considerations:**
- HTML reports: ~1-2 MB each
- With 3 Python versions: ~3-6 MB per run
- 30 days = ~180 MB maximum

## Debugging Workflow Failures

### If tests fail:

1. **Check workflow logs:**
   - PR â†’ Checks â†’ Click workflow name
   - View test output in "Run pytest" step

2. **Key failure indicators:**
   - `FAILED test_name` - Test assertion failed
   - `ERROR collecting` - Syntax error in code
   - `ImportError` - Missing dependency

3. **Run locally to replicate:**
   ```bash
   pytest tests/ -v --tb=short
   ```

### If coverage is below 80%:

1. **View HTML report** (from artifacts)
2. **Find red lines** (uncovered code)
3. **Add tests** for those lines
4. **Re-run locally:**
   ```bash
   pytest tests/ --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing
   ```

### If linting fails:

1. **Check code-quality logs**
2. **Run auto-fix locally:**
   ```bash
   ruff check . --fix
   ruff format .
   isort .
   ```
3. **Commit and push**

## CI/CD Metrics

### Current Performance

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Tests | 82 |
| Passing | 100% |
| Coverage | 99% |
| Threshold | 80% |
| Execution Time | ~0.1s |
| Python Versions | 3 |

### Historical Tracking

Monitor these over time:
- Test count (growing?)
- Coverage percentage (improving?)
- Execution time (degrading?)
- Failure rate (stable?)

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Problem: "Coverage below 80%"

**Solution:**
```bash
# See what's uncovered
pytest tests/ --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing

# Generate HTML report
pytest tests/ --cov=. --cov-report=html
open htmlcov/index.html
```

### Problem: "tests not found"

**Solution:**
- Ensure `pyproject.toml` has: `pythonpath = ["."]*
- Ensure test files are in `tests/` directory
- Ensure test files are named `test_*.py`

### Problem: "ImportError in workflow"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Try locally
pytest tests/ -v
```

### Problem: "Linting passes locally but fails in CI"

**Solution:**
- Ruff versions may differ
- Force same version:
  ```bash
  pip install ruff==0.14.2  # Update to version in requirements-dev.txt
  ruff check .
  ```

### Problem: "Artifact not available"

**Solution:**
- Check retention days (default 30)
- Workflow must complete successfully to upload
- Check "Upload coverage artifacts" step in logs

## Advanced Configuration

### Running specific Python versions only:

Edit `pytest-coverage.yml`:
```yaml
matrix:
  python-version: ['3.13']  # Just Python 3.13
```

### Excluding directories from coverage:

Edit `.github/workflows/pytest-coverage.yml`:
```bash
pytest tests/ \
  --cov=. \
  --cov-report=term-missing \
  --cov-config=.coveragerc  # Use config file
```

Create `.coveragerc`:
```ini
[run]
omit =
    */tests/*
    */venv/*
```

### Sending coverage to Codecov:

Add step to pytest-coverage.yml:
```yaml
- name: Upload to Codecov
  uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
  with:
    files: ./coverage.xml
    fail_ci_if_error: true
```
